h1. ONS Graphs

Generate graphs in the browser for "timeline datasets":http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/tsdtimezone.asp on the UK "Office for National Statistics":http://www.statistics.gov.uk/ website.

The Office for National Statistics has a wide range of data going back over many years, but it's a bit hard to access. The Navidata program for browsing the data sets is free but Windows-only, clumsy to use, and produces hard-to-read graphs. Since we can view tables of numerical data in the browser, we can also generate graphs. This makes the information easier to interpret, especially for Mac and Linux users.

h2. Using it

# Get "Firefox":http://getfirefox.com/
# Install "GreaseMonkey":https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/748
# Install "ons_graphs.user.js":http://github.com/threedaymonk/ons_graphs/raw/ea7224e36f91c8b6dc6abaf0aa3198bf4d87051b/ons_graphs.user.js

Browse to a "timeline dataset":http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/tsdtimezone.asp, *View Table*, *View Series*, *Add to Selection*, *Download* then *View On-Screen*. (Sorry, but we couldn't improve _that_ awful navigation experience so easily!) You should see a graph of the data at the top, like this:

h2. Warning

If you try to browse to the @ons_graph.user.js@ file in GitHub, GreaseMonkey will try to install it. Unfortunately, the monkey isn't so smart: he recognises the extension, but GitHub is actually serving up an HTML file. Do not let him install this file! It won't work.
